     <h3>Introduction</h3> <a name="intro"> </a>

    <p>
        This implementation guide conforms with the following key reporting requirements as identified by the Center for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) for COVID19 <a href="#ref1">(Labs, 2020)</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>How to Report</h3> <a name="how-to-report"> </a>

    <p>Laboratory data elements must be reported in one or more of the following ways.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Lab data can be submitted directly to an EMR electronically provided the communication stream adheres to country laws in regards to privacy &amp; confidentiality.
            Lab results must be shared with the requesting organisation/provider or individual as applicable.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lab data can be submitted directly to a <a href="https://jembi.gitbook.io/cares-on-platform/" target="_blank">centralised data repository, stripped of all personally identifiable information (PII) and later be routed to an analytics platform for reporting.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lab data can be submitted to an EMR via a health information exchange (HIE). It will be the responsibility of the interoperability layer to facilitate the mediation of the message to the correct destination system. 
        </li>
    </ol>
