    <h3>Introduction</h3> <a name="intro"> </a>

    <p>
        This implementation guide provides a framework which can be adopted to ensure messaging standards and compliance among implementers. 
        In other words, this is a governing framework that issues messaging requirements (allowed codes and code systems), 
        specifies the minimum required data elements per FHIR resource and also has control over which data elements are mandatory.

    <p class="heading">Prerequisites</p>

    <p>
        When preparing for the development of an implementation guide, the following key tasks will be essential.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Define a minimum dataset (MDS)</strong>: Identifify the informational requirements for specific use cases. I.e., what data elements are needed by the EMR and lab systems to be interoperable with regards to data availability?</li>
        <li><strong>Map the MDS fields to FHIR elements</strong>: Identify the appropriate FHIR resources and their data elements and establish a mapping with the MDS data elements.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Development Dependencies</h3> <a name="dependencies"> </a>

    <p>
        The following will need to be installed on your machine to support the development and testing of an implementation guide.
