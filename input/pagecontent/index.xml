  <h3>Introduction</h3> <a name="intro"> </a>

  <p>
    There is a need for countries to centralize and report on COVID19 data that is captured at the point of service systems by effectively monitoring and measuring individuals diagnosed with the disease and their status towards being up-to-date vaccinated. 
    The COVID19 <a href="vaccination_status.html">vacination status</a> of <em><strong>Up-to-date Vaccinated</strong></em> refers to those individuals who have been fully vaccinated (received all doses for the Primary Vaccine Series) and received all doses for the specified Booster Vaccine Series.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a content specific implementation guide that has been derived from the <a href="https://www.notion.so/gicsandbox/09ee19ee4fd34649a8cc07e1c171a84e?v=85d824b3ef9943ba92cb4204f6532ccf" target="_blank">COVID19 Minimum Dataset</a>.

  <h3>Summary</h3> <a name="summary"> </a>
  <p>
    The <a href="artifacts.html">artifacts page</a> provides examples of all the FHIR resources that have been built into this specification. Moreover, the following key example bundles exist.
  </p>

  <a href="emr-bundle.html"><p style="display: block;

  <p>
    The <a href="Bundle-EMR.html">EMR message bundle</a> contains the FHIR resources neccessary to support case reporting and immunization tracking for those individuals diagnosed COVID19 positive.
    This message bundle is typically executed from the EMR.

  <p>
    This implementation guide was developed as the messaging standards specification for one of the Data Integration Strategy &amp; Implementation (DISI) Platform reference solutions. 
    DISI proposes to create a standards-based architecture that would allow multiple countries to adopt a similar framework for generating reports that they require. Currently, there are two DISI Reference Implementations for data centralization and reporting, one for <a href="https://jembi.gitbook.io/disi-on-platform/" target="_blank">HIV</a> and another for <a href="https://jembi.gitbook.io/cares-on-platform/" target="_blank">COVID19</a>.
    <br />
    <br />
    The DISI acrhitecture brings forth a <a href="https://jembi.gitbook.io/jembi-platform/packages" target="_blank">set of components</a> that are common among HIV and COVID19. The DISI architecture can be seen below.

  <p>
    Using an application called <a href="https://www.postman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a>, you will be able to submit requests to the DISI Platform for processing &amp; reporting.
    <br />
    <br />
    There are two Postman Collections namely: 
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>COVID19 Postman Collection for the EMR</li>
    <li>COVID19 Lab Integration Postman Collection</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Please see our <a href="https://jembi.gitbook.io/cares-on-platform/postman-collections" target="_blank">Postman Collections for COVID19</a> as well as the descriptions for each of the message bundles that exist in each collection.

  <h3>Intellectual Property Considerations</h3>  <a name="ip"> </a>
  <p>
    While this implementation guide and the underlying FHIR are licensed as public domain, this guide may include examples making use of terminologies such 
    as LOINC, SNOMED CT and others which have more restrictive licensing requirements. Implementers should make themselves familiar with licensing and 
    any other constraints of terminologies, questionnaires, and other components used as part of their implementation process. In some cases, 
    licensing requirements may limit the systems that data captured using certain questionnaires may be shared with.
